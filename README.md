# Playing Bad Apple in Advantagescope

*Note: This project is incomplete and undocumented. I'll probably provide instructions on how to run the code in a bit. Time willing, I'd also like to add some more optimizations, as currently it's very laggy when playing large videos*

This project serves as a base for playing videos in AdvantageScope, a tool used for logging within the FIRST robotics competition (FRC)

It works by converting a video into black-and-white frame data, then playing that by loading lots of objects into ascope. Currently, I've been playing bad apple on it, but by using converter.py you can make it play almost any video, as long as your computer is powerful enough. 

It's certainly not practical, but it's a fun tool to play around with.
